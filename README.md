Hi, Iâ€™m Charlie! Iâ€™m a passionate student programmer: I build both the frontend and backend of all kinds of apps and programs, but Iâ€™m especially interested in delving into lower level protocols and network infrastructure - which has often led me to attempt my own version of popular protocols (see [my ongoing sycamore project](https://github.com/xjarlie/sycamore-v2)).

I'm spending most of my free time at the moment designing a 2D platformer game in the Godot Engine with a friend - it's still in early development, but there'll be a repo as soon as it actually has any code. I'm also working on learning Rust to complement my knowledge of JavaScript with (slightly) more low-level understanding.
